Upgrade Equipment is a mod that alllows you to upgrade your weapons sequentially. from +1, +2.. all the way up to +40. This is done with the help of a new NPC that can spawn from the beginning.
The upgrades currently work for most ranged/mage/melee weapons. I will focus on adding mod support for other classes later.
You can configure some values if you feel they might be annoying, such as size and knockback.
