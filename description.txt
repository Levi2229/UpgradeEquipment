Upgrade Equipment is a mod that alllows you to upgrade your weapons sequentially. from +1, +2.. all the way up to +40. This is done with the help of a new NPC that can spawn from the beginning.
The upgrades currently work for most ranged/mage/melee weapons. I will focus on adding mod support for other classes later.
You can configure some values if you feel they might be annoying, such as size and knockback.

Release notes:

Release 1.2.0
- Infinite throwing items are now able to be upgraded.
- Added option to change velocity boost amount (0 = no boost, 100 = default boost, 50 = 1/2 boost of default).
- Rebalanced a bit.

Release 1.1.0
-Upgrade tier limit is now set to 20 if the world is not in hardmode.

- minor fixes.
