Upgrade Equipment (hrr_) is a watered-down, tweaked version of oempa's Upgrade Equipment Mod.
The same basic features exist: kill mobs/bosses to get Upgrade Tokens to upgrade your weapons.
Weapons will gain a big boost in stats from +1 to +10. However, they will gain much smaller amounts until +255.
While upgraded weapons will still be extremely strong, they won't be as broken overpowered as they could be in the original.

CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL:
- Fixed support for most? damage types? Anything that can be reforged can be upgraded (tested on Expanded Sentries, SotS Void, Esper Telekinetic, Calamity Rogue, Thorium Symphonic/Radiant/Throwing)
- Fixed compatibility issue with newer Calamity versions but ITEMS WILL LOSE THEIR UPGRADE WHEN REFORGING WHEN PLAYING WITH CALAMITY.
- Rebalanced damage/crit chance/speed increases - lower gains across the board, but still meaningful
- Removed size/knockback/velocity increases
- Rebalanced upgrade token drop amounts
- Rebalanced upgrading costs
