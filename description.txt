Upgrade Equipment (hrr_) is a watered-down, tweaked version of oempa's Upgrade Equipment Mod.

Kill mobs and bosses for Upgrade Tokens, then use them to upgrade your weapons at the Upgrader NPC!

Differences from oempa's Version:
- Support for any damage type! - probably
- Fixed compatibility issue with newer Calamity versions but ITEMS WILL LOSE THEIR UPGRADE WHEN REFORGING (when playing with Calamity)
- Rebalanced damage / crit chance / speed increases entirely - weapons will still be strong, but not nearly as broken overpowered
- Removed size / knockback / velocity / mana increases entirely
- Rebalanced upgrade token drop amounts
- Rebalanced upgrading costs

Tested damage types: 
- Melee / Ranged / Magic / Summon / Throwing (Terraria)
- Rogue (Calamity)
- Sentry (Expanded Sentries)
- Void (Secrets of the Shadows)
- Telekinetic (Esper Class)
- Click (Clicker Class)
- Aura (Aura Class)
- Symphonic / Radiant / Throwing (Thorium)
- Chemical / Gambling / Shamanic (Orchid)
