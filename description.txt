Upgrade Equipment is a mod that alllows you to upgrade your weapons sequentially. from +1, +2, .., +39, all the way up to +40.
This is done with the help of a new NPC that can spawn from the beginning.
It currently works for most ranged/mage/melee weapons.

This is a first release, any feedback is appreciated, as I'm not sure how balanced it is.
You can configure some values if you feel they might be annoying, such as size and knockback.

NOTE:
This cannot be combined with other forms of prefixes or modifiers.
Does not work on accessories.
