# Upgrade Equipment (hrr\_)

Upgrade Equipment (hrr_) is a watered-down, tweaked version of oempa's Upgrade Equipment Mod. While upgraded weapons will still be extremely strong, they won't be as broken overpowered as they could've been in the original. 

Kill mobs and bosses for Upgrade Tokens, then use them to upgrade your weapons at the Upgrader NPC!

# Differences from oempa's Version:
- Support for any damage type! - probably
- Fixed compatibility issue with newer Calamity versions but ITEMS WILL LOSE THEIR UPGRADE WHEN REFORGING (when playing with Calamity)
- Rebalanced damage / crit chance / speed increases
- Removed size / knockback / velocity / mana increases entirely
- Rebalanced upgrade token drop amounts
- Rebalanced upgrading costs
